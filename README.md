### Hi there, I'm A-N-R-I

 I'm still finding my niche. I have a tendency to explore other languages. I love problem-solving even more than I love 
 programming. I've had a run with coding since around 2017. During this time I've experimented a tad bit with HTML, CSS, 
 JavaScript, Java, C++, Dart, and C#, amongst others. But I'm more of a generalist.  

ðŸŒ± I find the web intriguing, so I'm currently learning web development. 

ðŸ”­ Currently not working on anything.

My other interests, besides coding, include music, animation movies, series, and pretty much anything I  
find interesting.
