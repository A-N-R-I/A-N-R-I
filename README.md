### Hi there, I'm A-N-R-I

I'm currently a C# developer, with some tendency to explore other languages. I love problem-solving even more than I love 
 programming. I've had a run with coding since around 2017. During this time I've experimented a tad bit with HTML, CSS, 
 JavaScript, Java, C++, Dart, and C#, amongst others. But I'm more of a generalist.  

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning the basics of C#, and really looking forward to learning application development with C# and XAML. 

ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm working on a command-line-based retro-styled Snake game with C#.

My other interests, besides coding, include music, animation movies, series, and pretty much anything I  
find interesting.
